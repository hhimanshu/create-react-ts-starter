## Commands
- `./setup.sh` to install dependencies.
- `yarn start` to develop locally.
- `yarn test` to test and see the code coverage.
- `yarn test:watch` to test in the watch mode.
- `yarn build` to create a production build.
- `yarn lint` to lint your code using `eslint`.
- `yarn start-prod` to serve production build on port `5000`.
- `yarn storybook` to start storybook in development mode.
